# Portfolio

After being introduced to React I immediately knew I should use it to remake my portfolio website. Currently it is a SPA and it is in constant development as I expand my knowledge. Responsiveness has been tested using Responsively (https://responsively.app/), big kudos to them for creating this great tool. 

## Technologies used
React, SCSS
  - Including React Router, useState

## Project notes:
  - The "Project cards" are dynamically created, reading data from a js file in a similar way it would fetch from an API. 
  - My CV file is hosted on Google Docs
