   intro: "Throughout my previous career in hospitality, I had always been fascinated by all the tools technology gave us, such as our booking systems, till systems and intranet communications. So during the first Covid lockdown, it felt natural to delve more into how that technology worked and learn about coding. After months of self-study, I decided to take a 12 week Software Development course at _nology, to gain more hands on experience and expand my career prospects in the tech industry.",
